# Fast API Sample

This is a different approach to writing APIs using Python. Its like Flask but on steroids. FastAPI is a simple but unique modern approach to writing REST APIs. This repository takes it for a spin. I must say FastAPI is really dope!

## Installation
I am assuming you have used `virtualenv` before and that you are familiar with Python. This repository uses Python 3. 

Install the requirements:

` pip install -r requirements.txt ` 

Run the server:
` uvicorn main:app --reload ` 

Yeah, that simple! 

## One more thing. 

FastAPI has inbuilt APIDocs, a reload option thanks to Uvicorn and is epic fast! I think this is the future of REST APIs.
